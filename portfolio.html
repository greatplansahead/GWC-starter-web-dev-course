      <p>I made a smart alarm that rings during certain times of the day to remind me to turn off the light before I leave the house!. the alarm only turns off when the light in a room has been turned off! There is also an actual alarm clock that rings at a certain time. To turn that off, you have to pick the circuit up!<br>Click the photo to go to my project!</p>
